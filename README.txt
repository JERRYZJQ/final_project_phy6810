This project focus on the ODE algorithms. In particular, this project will apply the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg algorithm, or rk45, in c++ code practice. A few subgoals for now include :
1.	Re-write the rk45 python code in “A Survey of Computational Physics”, chapter 9.5 into c++. 
2.	Integrating the rk45 and rk2 into the Session_06 work and generating a well-formed program (there are already Euler and rk4 in session06 code)
3.	Do error analysis for all above
